mongodb:
It is nosql db. It is based on Hierarchical structure. It is unstructured .It stored data in form of json.
mongodb uses collections just like sql has tables.

how to connect mongodb?
- so i used mongodb cluster and i used async await callback functions to call my database url that generated in our cluster cloud

difference btw compass and cluster?
- cluster is cloud base so we can retrieve data from anywhere where as we need to install compass in our system and it works locally.

mongodb queries:
insert : db.(tablename).insertOne({"name":"yogesh"}) insertMany
update : db.(tablename).updateOne({"class-12":"secD"})
delete : db.(tablename).drop()


what is ur project functionality?
we can create our own travelling package and for this i used basic crud operation in which for creating a package i made an api in express that send data to db and store there.
i also reflect the same package on our website that we just created.for this i have created another api that retrive the data from db and show on our website.






post = to send data
get = to get data
put/update = to update data
delete = to delete data
